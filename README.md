<h1>Design for manual assembly snap-fit bottle cap</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I collaborated a team of 5 students to design, build, and test their snap-fit bottle cap prototype. I resopnsible for designing CAD model prototype, calculated and performed structural analysis to find the force required to assemble the snap-fit. The snap-fit bottle cap will be attached to an existing 1.5L carbonated drink bottle, replacing its regular bottle cap.
